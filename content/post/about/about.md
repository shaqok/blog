Hi, welcome to my blog! I am Daniel Daeyeon Kim and I am an international student from South Korea at Carleton College, Northfield, MN - Class of 2023.
I major in Computer Science and also recently started to explore Statistics, which led me to work at [Carleton ITS DataSquad](https://carletondatasquad.bitbucket.io/) as a current student programming assistant.
My primary interests in CS are building user-friendly services and learning new skills or languages, and I am planning to expand my interests more and more!
Outside of coding, I enjoy watching soccer, playing pok√©mon, and listening to music or sometimes making music.
